The game was written for iOS devices in September 2016 by John Morales, Adi Surya and Alex Wapniarski, at the Coding Dojo in San Jose, CA. 

We wrote this in Swift, specifically using CoreMotion and SpriteKit. 

# Playing the game

To play, simply start the app, move the crosshairs around the screen by tilting the device. When the crosshair is lined up with the target, click anywhere on the screen to take a shot. A sound effect will play, and the shot will be compared to the target. If the target is hit, it will disappear, and another will be drawn in a different location. Scoring is based on how close the shot is to the center.
